# NARC: Norwegian Anaphora Resolution Corpus

The Norwegian Anaphora Resolution Corpus (NARC) is the first publicly available corpus annotated with anaphoric relations between noun phrases for Norwegian.
The annotation effort enriches the existing annotation of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT).
The accompanying [paper](NARC_CRAC.pdf) by MÃ¦hlum et al. at CRAC 2022 describes the (1st release of the) data in more detail.
