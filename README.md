# NARC: Norwegian Anaphora Resolution Corpus

The Norwegian Anaphora Resolution Corpus (NARC) is the first publicly available corpus annotated with anaphoric relations between noun phrases for Norwegian.
The annotation effort enriches the existing annotation of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT).
The accompanying [paper](NARC_CRAC.pdf) by Mæhlum et al. at CRAC 2022 describes the (1st release of the) data in more detail.

## Data sources

The underlying data for the annotation effort is the Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT), a richly annotated dataset. 
The original treebank contains  manually  annotated  syntactic and morphological information for both varieties of written Norwegian -- Bokmål and Nynorsk -- comprising roughly 300,000 tokens of each and a total of around 600,000 tokens. The corpus contains a majority of news texts (comprising around 85\% of the corpus), but also other types of texts, such as government reports, parliamentary transcripts and blog data.
